# Letter Boxed Solver

This is a CLI solver for *The New York Times's* [Letter
Boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed) game. It allows you to:

 - Check for the number of solutions of a given length without being spoiled
 - See all of the solutions for different lengths of words
 
 Note that the dictionary being used is not the same as the one on the site because I don't think
 that one is publicly accessible. I'm using the `2of12inf` list from [this
 repo](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist).
